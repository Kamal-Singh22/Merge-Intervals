# Merge-Intervals
Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [start, end], merge all overlapping intervals and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.
Explanation:
Sorting:

The intervals are sorted based on their start times using Arrays.sort with a custom comparator.
Merge Process:

Start with the first interval.
For each subsequent interval:
If it overlaps with the current interval, merge them by updating the end time of the current interval.
If it doesnâ€™t overlap, add the current interval to the list and move to the next one.
Return Result:

Convert the List<int[]> to a 2D array using toArray().
